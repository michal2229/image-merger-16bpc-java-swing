# image-merger-16bpc-java-swing

Java + Swing application to merge (average, darker only, lighter only, difference) many images into output image. 

It works with relatively high precision (16 bits per color channel vs 8bpc in standard image), so it allows to achieve high quality image with good editing prerequisites (no visible image degradations).
